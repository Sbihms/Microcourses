Windows event log types:

Application Log: any event logged by an application. 
System Log: operating system (ex: failure to start a drive)
Security Log: any event that matters to security (ex: deleting files, failing to login, etc)
Directory service log: records events of AD - only available on a domain controller
	- DNS Server log
	- File replication service log

Event log classifications:

Information - event that describes the successful operation of a task, such as an application, driver, or service. 
Warning - not necessarily significant; however, may indicate the possible occurrence of a future problem.
Error - Problem or error.

Understanding an event:

Event log headers include the following information:
	- Date, time, user, computer, eventID, source, and type (warning, error, info, etc)

Critical security events that need auditing (but may not be getting audited):
	- User log on/off
	- Computer logon/logoff/restart
	- Access to objects, files, folders
	- System time is modified
	- Audit logs are cleared
